RoboCup ("Robot Soccer World Cup") is an international ongoing robotics competition founded in 1997.The official goal of the project: "By mid-21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win the soccer game, complying with the official rule of the FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup." \cite{wwwRoboCup}
There are a lot of topics of automation and control contained in this project. One is the topic of estimation, which is a part of our group work. The goal of our work is to build a cooperative estimation and prediction of player and ball movement. A detailed description and further informations about the goal of our group work can be found in the appendix \ref{PrjDescription}.
Therefore we have to estimate the position of the robot on it's own and the position of the other robots and the ball. In a second step we have to fuse all the measurements together to a big point of view and then to decide whether the data from the robots are reliable.

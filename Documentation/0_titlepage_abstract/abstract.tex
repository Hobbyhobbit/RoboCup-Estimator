Reliable estimation and prediction are important components for the ETHZ RoboCup Team to win the annual world cup of the Standard Nao Platform League in near future. This paper presents the most important ideas and results of our Group Work in estimation and prediction of a robot soccer match on the Standard Nao Platform. In a first part the simulation of robot and ball movements and the underlying implementation in MATLAB are described and discussed. The second part provides a short theoretical insight in Kalman-filtering and the application of this theory in the framework of the simulation. The last part of this work deals with the multiplicity of measurements and the need of sensor fusion which comes along with this. This Group Work claims to provide a good basis for further investigations in the area of estimation such as improvements in Kalman filtering or sensor fusion and the migration of the implementation on the Nao Platform.

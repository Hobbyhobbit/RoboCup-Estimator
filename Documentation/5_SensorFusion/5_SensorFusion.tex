\chapter{Sensor Fusion}
In RoboCup every robot works autonomous except a WLAN connection between the teammates. So the whole team can share information to optimize their game.
Through his field of view every robot can bring in some informations about the playing field, other robots and about the ball. Now to optimize the estimation and to exploit the informations from the robots, the team can share this informations in form of a sensor fusion algorithm.
With such a intelligent sensor fusion algorithm the...

\section{Sensors of the Robots}
The robots comes with a camera with a defined field of view. There are no other sensors or informations with can be used for estimation of the positions.
